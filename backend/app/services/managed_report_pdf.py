"""The event report PDF: one event, or several in one document.

Both reports use it -- the Event Manager's and the Dean's -- so they share one
design: the letterhead, styles, footer and sign-off (app/services/report_pdf.py),
and the same sections in the same order. The only differences are what each
workflow has: the Dean's report says who submitted the event and closes with
its approval (ReportEntry.approval), the Event Manager's says who recorded it
and has no approval anywhere. The material itself is the same --

- every detail entered when the event was recorded,
- up to four photos, each at its original aspect ratio (never cropped),
  arranged as one compact block whatever mix of portrait and landscape
  they are (see layout_photos),
- every uploaded file listed with a download link.

The builder only lays out what it is given: the router loads the photo bytes
and signs the download links, so this module never touches storage.
