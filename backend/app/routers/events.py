# Archiving is deliberately NOT a status. `status` carries the review
# lifecycle, and every gate in this module reads it -- overwriting it with
# "archived" would destroy the state that restore has to return the event to.
# The shelf is a separate axis: `archived_at` set means shelved, None (or
# absent) means live. MongoDB matches missing and null alike, so existing
# documents need no backfill.
