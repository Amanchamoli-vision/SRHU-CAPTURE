"""The Dean's Teacher-account management.

Every route here acts on **Teacher accounts only**. The target is always looked
up with ``role: "teacher"`` in the filter -- and every write repeats that
condition -- so a Dean can never reach a superadmin, another Dean or their own
account, and a teacher promoted or deleted between the read and the write is
not modified by a stale request.

What deliberately differs from the superadmin equivalents in superadmin.py:

* No password is ever sent or returned. A teacher is *invited*: emailed a
  one-time link (POST /auth/accept-invite) to choose their own password. The
  superadmin's routes still hand out temporary passwords; a Dean never does.
* "Reset password" issues the same one-time link as /auth/forgot-password
  and leaves the current password working until the teacher chooses a new one.
* Emails are sent synchronously, so the Dean sees each teacher's real outcome.
  An invitation link is stored only after its email was accepted, so a failed
  send never replaces a link the teacher already has.
* A Dean *removes* a teacher (hidden, signed out, every record kept) and can
  restore them. Permanent deletion is only for a teacher with no events --
  the typical case being a wrong import -- because it erases their events,
  media and reports.

Audit entries reuse the superadmin's action names where the action is the
same (so the superadmin's existing audit filters include Dean actions) and all
carry ``details.via = "dean_panel"`` so the Dean panel can list its own.
