"""Start the API server.

Locally (`python run.py`) it listens on 0.0.0.0:8000 with auto-reload, so
phones and laptops on the same network can reach it.

On Railway the platform sets PORT, which switches auto-reload off. Railway ends
HTTPS at its proxy, so the proxy headers are trusted: without them every request
looks like plain http and the /files/... URLs handed to the browser would be
http://, which an https frontend blocks as mixed content.
